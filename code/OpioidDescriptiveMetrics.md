# Opioid Descriptive Metrics
These descriptive metrics are intended to nudge epidemiology research and clinical pain treatment decisions to be more closely aligned. The list of metrics can be implemented in healthcare research databases with medication utilization data like insurance claims, prescription monitoring programs, and electronic health records. Some metrics rely on diagonsis or procedure codes (e.g., not available in state PMP data), and should be tailored to specific needs.

## Data format
The data are expected to take a standard form. Standard variable naming conventions are as follows:<br>
